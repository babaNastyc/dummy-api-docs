# API Overview

The Dummy API provides a simple RESTful interface for managing resources. All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1`.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```text
https://api.example.com
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

For more details, see the [Authentication](/docs/api/authentication) guide.

## Endpoints

### Status

Check the API status and version.

```text
GET /v1/status
```

### Resources

Manage resources through CRUD operations.

```text
GET    /v1/resources
POST   /v1/resources
GET    /v1/resources/:id
PUT    /v1/resources/:id
DELETE /v1/resources/:id
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include the requested data:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "The request is invalid",
    "details": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per API key. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```text
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```
