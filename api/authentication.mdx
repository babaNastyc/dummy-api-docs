# Authentication

The Dummy API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests must include a valid API key in the request headers.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your requests to the API. Each API key is associated with your account and has specific permissions.

### Getting an API Key

1. Log in to your account dashboard
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy and securely store your API key

**Important:** API keys are only shown once when created. Make sure to save them securely.

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/v1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/status', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/status', headers=headers)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to version control** – Use environment variables instead
2. **Rotate keys regularly** – Update your API keys periodically
3. **Use different keys for different environments** – Separate keys for development and production
4. **Restrict key permissions** – Only grant necessary permissions to each key
5. **Monitor key usage** – Regularly check your API key usage logs

## Environment Variables

Store your API key in environment variables:

```bash
export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Then use it in your requests:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/v1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```
